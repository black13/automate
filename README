========= what is this? ===============================================
 this project features an automate editor class with a graphical- and tree- like editor.
 this project can be used as a library to visualize directed graphs.

 it was created at the University of Tuebingen, Germany as a 'Studienarbeit'.
 Chair: Arbeitsbereich fuer Theoretische Informatik/Formale Sprachen

 most of the code was written by me:

  ahigerd, kibab, chakie, rohanpm, thiago, blight_, martin- and those i have forgotten

 thanks for the help of Christian Behle and Andreas Krebs who created the specification
 for this work and always had time when i needed them.

 most used icons are from the kde icon theme noia-kde-icons-1.00.tgz

========== what is this not? ================================================== 
there is no auto-layout function so all the stuff has to be done by you.
it would be nice if we could use the graphviz API for doing that...

========== how to use? ================================================== 
i have to review this list again but in general it should give you an
idea what can be done.
