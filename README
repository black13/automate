======================================
 what is this?
======================================
  a complete automate code base with a lightweight automatehandler
  this codebase is converted into full MCV compatibility and
  a new property system is evaluated for usage

  the main changes the the previous versions is that:
   a) all objects derive from the same abstract base class nodeItem
      all objects must be accessed from either the model (normal way)
      or in special cases the automate can be copied without using
      the model
   b) all objects share their properties in a common array

======================================
 why?
======================================
i've implemented this as a library for later use in a more complex
environment.

see TODO for more information about what is still left to be done.

this automate class code is GPL v2, see GPL_V2 for more info

======================================
 class documentation using doxygen
======================================
run doxygen to get a nice html documentation with helpful comments
