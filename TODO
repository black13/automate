FIXME modeltest.cpp line 106 issue
FIXME treeView, adding a new connection isn't marked with a + in the treeView node line!
FIXME implement hasChildren
FIXME BUG in drawing of SceneItem_Connection: items get invisible from time to time
FIXME use parentWidget() and parent where possible
FIXME 1. BUG when deleting a selection of connecvtions it crashes from time to time
      and when deleting nodes sometimes head-less connections are left in the field
      2. BUG when deleting sometimes connections are not removed from the grpahicsView but they
         are removed from the model, tested with treeView since there are not connections left
         it must be a bug in the graphicsView callback to remove the QGraphicItems... ;P
FIXME we need a flex item

graphicsview:
 - create a connection by draging with MMB from startnode to endnode
 - relocate a connection by draging with MMB from startnode/endnode to a startnode/endnode
 - connection: highlight on mouse over
 - enable opengl rendering
 - ICONS for ACTIONS:
   - enable/disable opengl rendering
   - enable/disable antialiasing
   - enable/disable highlight by mouse over node / mouse over connection
 - grid
   - show/hide grid
   - enable/disable grid magnification
   - inc/dec grid spacing

 - drawing of loops
 - implement 'flow' -> this feature will move overlapping nodes away from each and
                       it does so for connection labels as well
 - printing
   is working with pressing 's' in graphicsView, needs some more love tough
 - mash modulator with radius modifier
   this feature enables a mesh modification as seen in blender

items which have to be editable:
                            treeView    graphicsview
 - start                    -           editable
 - final                    -           editable
 - connection symbol        editable    -

   \ by click               editable    editable
 - select a single conn.
   \ by boundingbox         -           editable
   \ by click               editable    -
 - reconnect on the fly     editable    -
  (in the graphicsView we need a handle for this)

 - add symbol editor
 - allg. doku mit doxygen wo die wichtigsten konzepte erklaert
  - some documentation is needed, F1 should open a browser for that

- see TODO and BUG notices in the code as well

 - cleanup automate
   - clean all TODOs in the code

 - doxygen comments on code and concepts
 - think about if automate/meta_automate need a
   copy constructor ... -> rule of three
   - copy an automate 1:1

Later
 - add 'invert all connections' to automate_algorithms
 - remerge automate_algorithms to trunk

 - getAutomateType
   create a better detection of automate type
 - checkWord
   iterative word check implementation for eNFA/NFA/DFA
 - editing ohne MCV aufsatz z.b. fuer schnelle algorithmen (example code dafuer)

 - skalieren(?) je nach dem wie du es implementierst.
