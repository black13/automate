FIXME graphicsitem
  - BUG if connectionLabel is moved between two nodes it's resizing on node move is correct
    BUT if the connectionLabel is moved beyond on node it's resizing is done into the wrong direction
    -> while the distance between the nodes shrinks the object moves even farer away
  - add arrow
  - drawing of loops
  - fix object initialisation of a connection
    - two overlapping connectionLabels should be drawn RED!
  - fix connectionItem bbox
  - make it draw bezier even better!
    - current issue: when connectionLabel comes near to start or end node it's screwed
    - bezier is drawn right from the beginning of a node not outside of it's shape
  DONE  - remove trembling when moving an connectionLabel
FIXME node/connection label editor with QGraphicsTextItem
    void DiagramTextItem::focusOutEvent(QFocusEvent *event)
    {
        setTextInteractionFlags(Qt::NoTextInteraction);
        emit lostFocus(this);
        QGraphicsTextItem::focusOutEvent(event);
        qDebug() << toPlainText ();
    }
FIXME2 bbox issue. when two node items collide, the bbox is out of scope?!
       moving the mouse in the bbox results in the errors from FIXME1
FIXME label needs caching inside a node/connection since each redraw triggers a model query
FIXME1 BUG: when adding new nodes/connections or when moving nodes with attached connections VERY fast in the view sometimes
      the program hangs with this error:
  QPainterPath::cubicTo: Adding point where x or y is NaN, results are undefined
  QPainterPath::lineTo: Adding point where x or y is NaN, results are undefined
  QPainterPath::arcTo: Adding arc where a parameter is NaN, results are undefined
  ...
  HINT: this might be the drawing of an connection in the GraphicsScene
  HINT: it is the presumption form above: when two nodes nearly overlap this can happen
      CODE if ( myStartItem->collidesWithItem( myEndItem ) )
      CODE  return;
      when this two lines in SceneItem_Connection are commented we can trigger this issue
FIXME label and symboleditor
  - nodes display the customLabel item all the time, this custom label is initially set based on the id
    id is only shown in the toolTip
  - connections show the QString based on the symbol_index they contain
    id is only shown in the toolTip
FIXME add symbol editor featuring a QStringList model
  maps int to QString
  0 - not defined
  1 - epsilon connection
  2. first symbol or string
  3. ...











FIXME zoomFit
FIXME reset() in custom graphicsView
FIXME removeNodes reverse lookup must be wrong, all incomming connections are NOT deleted
      when the node goes offline ;P
FIXME treeView, adding a new connection isn't marked with a '+' sign in the treeView node line!
      HINT: check the row/column in dataChanged() call, maybe this is the fix?!
      HINT: maybe implement hasChildren as well
      HINT: if layouChanged() is used, it works BUT this is not good since it should work without!
      HINT: it's working for removeRows however AND once '+' was clicked (meaning the item should expand)
            it will be working when the item is removed and after no child is there anymore again an item is added
            it will stop working again when you hit the '-' and try delete all + add one item again
            - the view will update correctly if the widget is clicked anywhere?! why?
      HINT: http://lists.trolltech.com/qt-interest/2007-06/thread00580-0.html
FIXME modeltest.cpp line 106 issue
FIXME editing ohne MCV aufsatz z.b. fuer schnelle algorithmen (example code dafuer)
      z.b. print auf console code
FIXME program won't terminate on close
FIXME doxygen comments on code and concepts
 - allg. doku mit doxygen wo die wichtigsten konzepte erklaert
 - some documentation is needed, F1 should open a browser for that
FIXME see TODO and BUG notices in the code as well
 - clean all TODOs in the code

FINAL
 - usability testing
 - remove debug output

FIXME use parentWidget() and parent where possible
FIXME nodes should appear under mouse cursor not randomly if added from the GraphicsView
      fix it here: QGraphicsItem* GraphicsScene::nodeInserted( QPersistentModelIndex item ) {
FIXME ICONS for ACTIONS:
  - enable/disable opengl rendering
FIXME GraphicsScene: replace keyPressEvent code with QShortCut/QAction

graphicsView:
 - grid
  - show/hide grid
  - enable/disable grid magnification
  - inc/dec grid spacing
 - implement 'flow' -> this feature will move overlapping nodes away from each and
                       it does so for connection labels as well
 - add rotation handle

  misc:
  add this to the documentaiton for futher reading

todo
      LMB                     -> select node/connection
      LMB drag                -> bbox for selecting objects
      MMB on nodes            -> connect them
x     MMB on empty space      -> move view
      RMB on node/connection  -> context menu
      RMB on scene            -> ??????????????

general:
 - add 'invert all connections' to automate_algorithms
 - re-merge automate_algorithms to trunk
 - getAutomateType
   create a better detection of automate type
 - checkWord
   iterative word check implementation for eNFA/NFA/DFA
 - think about if automate/meta_automate need a
   copy constructor ... -> rule of three
   - copy an automate 1:1
