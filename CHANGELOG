FIXME add caching in SceneItem_Node,SceneItem_Connection,SceneItem_ConnectionHandle,... for model lookups
FIXME1 BUG: when adding new nodes/connections or when moving nodes with attached connections VERY fast in the view sometimes
      the program hangs with this error:
  QPainterPath::cubicTo: Adding point where x or y is NaN, results are undefined
  QPainterPath::lineTo: Adding point where x or y is NaN, results are undefined
  QPainterPath::arcTo: Adding arc where a parameter is NaN, results are undefined
  ...
  HINT: this might be the drawing of an connection in the GraphicsScene
  HINT: it is the presumption form above: when two nodes nearly overlap this can happen
      CODE if ( myStartItem->collidesWithItem( myEndItem ) )
      CODE  return;
      when this two lines in SceneItem_Connection are commented we can trigger this issue
FIXME readd contextMenu in connectionHandles
  *sigh* now it's a QObject again, didn't want to do that but that was the only good solution
