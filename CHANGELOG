  - added support for placing a node under the cursor
    this means: when designing an automate one can now just move the cursor to a place
    one wants a node and press 'n' to get one. this is great since it makes creating
    automates much faster
  - WARNING: found out that this codebase needs some serious refactoring
  - WARNING: this codebase has a bug, i must check if that was also true for the last
             revision or if it is a qt 4.5 problem in general
	     the bug occures when a graphicsview is created -> it will crash the computer 
	     here ;P

  - added custom loop handling so that loops can be moved to any location. 
    this 'fixed' loop labelItem position was now changed to be moved to any
    other position which helps to get better layouts.
  - added GPL notice to any source file
  - added GPL_V3 file
  - registered project at savannah (this last CHANGELOG wasn't added there)
    but the fixes are of course uploaded there)

  fixed: graphicsitem: bezier issues
  - drawing of loops is now possible
  - "remove custom transformation" for loops does work now as it is disabled now for loops
  - add arrow head for normal connections
  - semi-fixed connectionItem bbox (still not perfect use 'u' to manually update)
  - bezier drawing:
    - bezier drawing is now disabled
  - bbox issue: after layoutConnections in SceneItem_Node.cpp the bbox's old content is
    not removed when object is drawn somewhere else. this is now fixed.

  added a new feature:
    - new connections are now pointing to NULL with next_node. Now one knows if a node is a loop
      or if it isn't initialized yet with checking next_node for NULL in a node_connection
      This feature helps to minimize drawing of the graphicsView since NULL connections as one can
      call them won't be drawn at all while loops will be handled at least in a stub handler right
      now which will be implemented in the next release.

  FIXME add caching in SceneItem_Node,SceneItem_Connection,SceneItem_ConnectionHandle,... for model lookups
  FIXME1 BUG: when adding new nodes/connections or when moving nodes with attached connections VERY fast in the view sometimes
        the program hangs with this error:
    QPainterPath::cubicTo: Adding point where x or y is NaN, results are undefined
    QPainterPath::lineTo: Adding point where x or y is NaN, results are undefined
    QPainterPath::arcTo: Adding arc where a parameter is NaN, results are undefined
    ...
    HINT: this might be the drawing of an connection in the GraphicsScene
    HINT: it is the presumption form above: when two nodes nearly overlap this can happen
        CODE if ( myStartItem->collidesWithItem( myEndItem ) )
        CODE  return;
        when this two lines in SceneItem_Connection are commented we can trigger this issue
  FIXME readd contextMenu in connectionHandles
    *sigh* now it's a QObject again, didn't want to do that but that was the only good solution
